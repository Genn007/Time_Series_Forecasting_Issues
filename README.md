# Time_Series_Forecasting_Issues
Various Issues in ML TSF

This repository shall serve as a folder for my notebooks, related to the area of Time Series Analysis/Forecasting (TSA/TSF) in ML. 

Notebooks in oder of appearance:

**TargetEncoding_in_TS_Rus.ipynb** - Notebook on introduction of target encoding in TSF in Russian language. In this notebook, an approach is proposed for modeling the seasonal components of time series using a tabular representation, that is, without trying to expand such a component in a Fourier series. The approach allows simulating multiple overlapping seasonal fluctuations and significantly reduces the complexity of the machine learning problem. The approach is applicable for analysis, modeling and forecasting of time series. A tabular representation can be efficiently implemented in Python using a dictionary or pandas DataFrame.
